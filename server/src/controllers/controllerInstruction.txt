1.Fist you have to create a folder for specific task.Inside the folder you have to create the file.

2.Naming Conventions for file

File Names: files should start with a lowercase letter, use camelCase, and end with a .controller.js suffix. For example: user.controller.js etc.File can contain multiple  function. 

3.U have use try catch block for every cases to handle error.

For example here is a simple code.

exports.getQuestionAndAnswer = async (req, res, next) => {
  try {

    // Retrieve all documents from
     the QuestionAns collection
     
    const questions = await QuestionAns.find(); 

    successResponse(res, {
      payload: questions,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    next(error);
  }
};
